# Shadow Opportunist

A lightweight SKSE plugin that applies temporary bonuses when the player is detected while sneaking.

---

## Clone and Build

Open terminal (e.g., PowerShell) and run the following commands:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/gabriel-andreescu/ShadowOpportunist.git
cd ShadowOpportunist
cmake --preset=build-release
cmake --build --preset=release
```

Optionally:

```
cp CMakeUserPresets.json.template CMakeUserPresets.json
```

### **Debugging**

- [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless/releases)

#### Option 1:

- set `WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER` to `ON` in your CMake preset
- run `skse64_loader.exe`
- attach debugger to `SkyrimSE.exe`

#### Option 2:

- build [SKSE](https://github.com/ianpatt/skse64) from sources with the Debug config
- copy the built files and their PDB to the Skyrim folder
- run `skse64_loader.exe`
- attach debugger to `SkyrimSE.exe`

### **Deployment**

Use the `deploy-debug` preset (see `CMakeUserPresets.json.template`) to automatically copy the plugin to your Skyrim
Data directory, if configured.

For deployment to multiple targets split the paths with a `;` (e.g., `C:/path1/data;C:/path2/data`)

### **Packaging**

By default, a 7z archive is outputted in the `dist` folder if using the `build-release` or `build-debug` presets.

---

### **INI Settings**

On first run, the plugin creates a config file at:

```
Data/SKSE/Plugins/ShadowOpportunist.ini
```
